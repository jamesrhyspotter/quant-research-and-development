    "Quantitative Trading: The process of order execution based on trading signals generated using computer programs and algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models: having an input and mapping it to a usable output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Input data: Financial Data, News, Economic Indicators, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output data: Trading signals, portfolio weights, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robust Algorithms are identified by\n",
    "- backtesting; simulating the algorithms performance using historical data\n",
    "- here we can test its limitations, and fie tune the parameters to optimise results. \n",
    "- This may result in overfitting and survivorship bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantitative Trading\n",
    "Mathematical models to get patterns and get robust trading signals from financial data. \n",
    "We do data collection, preprocessiing, feature engineering, model development, backtesting, optimisation and execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to convert unstructured data into structured data. Or we use structured data from balanced sheet or firm specific technical indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "We categorise input data into 4 groups\n",
    "- market states \n",
    "- financial news \n",
    "- Fundamental - firm specific metrics and sector specific metrics\n",
    "- Technicals - technical indicators based on raw price series, moving averages and stochastic indicators\n",

    "We can be rule based: explicityly defined rules for trading or data driven: using machine learning to learn the rules from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Development Workflow\n",
    "Model development is concernded with input output pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Model: combination of inputs and architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We get a predicted value and get the error metric. We then adjust the model to minimise error. We repeat this as a feedback loop.\n",

    "### Institutional Algorithmic Trading\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying decision model could be a black box, so algorithic trading can also be called robo-trading, blackbox trading or automated trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insitutional algorithmic trading is the process of using computer programs to generate trading signals and execute trades on behalf of an institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We break these models up to break up large orders into smallers ones to reduce execution risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "Slippage: when a market paricipant gets a different execution price than the one they expected.\n",
    "\n",

    "Being a quant trader: using mathematical models and quantitive analysis to generate trading signals and execute trades on behalf of an institution.\n",
    "- Uses data driving methods\n",
    "- Familiar with mathematical and statistical concepts\n",
    "- Needs to be comfortable with mathmematical programming\n",
    "- Handling high pressure\n",
    "- Not risk averse but can handle risk where needed\n",
    "- Needs to act swiftly using self-developed programs to capitalise on the current training opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Major Asset Classes and Intruments\n",
    "Used to raise capital in public and private markets. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Stock: Also called equity. shares of ownership in a company. Stock owner benefits from the company's growth and profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonds: Fixed income securities that represent a loan to a company or government. Fixed income assets are debt securities that pay a fixed interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Annuities: Financial products that provide a stream of income over a period of time. Guranteed stream of income. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cash and Equivalents: Highly liquid assets that can be easily converted to cash. Highly short term. Bank accounts, near term instruments, money market funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commodities: Raw materials used in production of goods. Gold, oil, wheat, corn, etc. Can be traded in futures markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forwards: Non-standardised contracts that lock in the exchange rate for a future date. Used to hedge against currency risk. Over the counter. Price is settled at end of the agreement\n",
    "\n",
    "Options: Financial contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price on or before a certain date. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currencies: Foreign exchange market is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "ETFs: Exchange Traded Funds are baskets of securities that trade on stock exchanges like stocks. Pooled investments of stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, or other assets. \n",
    "\n",
    "REITS: Real Estate Investment Trusts are companies that own and manage real estate properties. They issue shares to investors who receive a portion of the rental income and capital gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual Funds: Pooled investments of stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, or other assets. Managed by professional fund managers. Can be purchased through each trading day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hedge Funds: Actively managed investment pools that aim at earning above-average returns for investors via a wide range of (often risky) trading strategies at the expense of higher fees than conventional investment funds\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Grouping Tradable Assets\n",
    "As asset class is a collection of asset intruments that exhibit fundamental characteristics in terms of risk and return.\n",
    "\n",
    "<image src=\"../images/common_asset_classes.png\" width=\"1000\"></image>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Grouping Assets by Maturity\n",
    "Alternaively we can group assets based on the type of maturity\n",
    "\n",
    "Stocks, currencies and commodities are asset classes with no maturity\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed income instruments and derivatives have maturities. \n",
    "\n",
    "For vanilla security with no maturity date, such as futures contract, it is possible to compute its fair price based on the no artibtrage argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Grouping By Pay Off Function\n",
    "We can also group assets by the payoff function at maturity for certain derivative instruments. \n",
    "\n",
    " Illustration of the linear payoff function of entering a long or short position in a futures contract\n",
    "\n",
    "<image src=\"../images/linear_payoff_function.png\" width=\"1000\"></image>\n",
    "\n",
    "S<sub>t</sub>: underlying stock price at the maturity date\n",
    "<i>K</i>: agreed price\n",
    "\n",
    "When buyer enters/longs a futures contract to buy the stock at price K, the buyer would make a profit if S<sub>t</sub> - K, S<sub>t</sub> >= K. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other derivative products with linear payoff functions include:\n",
    "- Forwards \n",
    "- Swaps\n",
    "\n",
    "These are easy to price since thier prices are linear functions of the underlying asset price. These are subject to model independent pricing as we can price them irrespective of the underlying model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non Linear Payoff Functions\n",
    "<image src=\"../images/non_linear_payoff_function.png\" width=\"1000\"></image>\n",
    "\n",
    "A call option gives the buyer a choice to buy the underlying asset at a fixed price K at maturity date T.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 combinations when participating in an options contract: \n",
    "\n",
    "Long a call: Buy a call option to obtain the opportunity to buy the underlying asset at a prespecified strike price upon maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Short a call: Sell a call option to allow the buyer the opportunity to buy the underlying asset at a prespecified strike price upon maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long a put: Buy a put option to obtain the opportunity to sell the underlying asset at a prespecified strike price upon maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Short a put: Sell a put option to allow the buyer the opportunity to sell the underlying asset at a prespecified strike price upon maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grouping Trading Assets by whether is belongs to Cash Market or Derivative Market\n",
    "- cash market: also called spot market, intruments are exchanged on point of sale. Purchases take immediate possesion of the trading products\n",
    "- ie stock exchanges\n",
    "\n",
    "- derivative market: transaction is completed at a specified future date. \n",
    "- ie futures market: a buyer pays for the right to receive a good only on a future date. \n",

    "### Common Trading Avenues and Steps\n",
    "Profit making and risk management are the two main objectives of trading. \n",
    "\n",
    "We observe the market and act on trading signals. \n",
    "\n",
    "We initiate a trade by entering a market order. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is market timing: enters or exits the market at a specific time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Buy and hold: buy an asset and hold it for a long time. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to understand the seasonality of the market and assets. This fluctuates throughout the day and the year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Trading activities can happen at one of the following 4 avenues:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regulated exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dark pools, private exchanges that are less regulated\n",
    "\n",
    "- Brokered market, where transactions between the buyer and the seller are performed via middlemen called brokers (or agents, intermediaries)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Over-the-counter (OTC) market, a decentralized market that allows direct transactions between buyers and sellers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anatomy of a Trade\n",
    "- Acquisition of information and quoutes\n",
    "- before engaging in a trade, it is important to access quality information about the asset and gain transparency in many tangible and intangible factors such as supply and demand, risk attitude of investors and the overall economic and geopolitical environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Routing order \n",
    "- Selecting the brokers to handle the trades or deciding which markets to transmit and execute trades. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Execution of order\n",
    "- Matching and executing the trading orders between buyers and sellers according to rules of a particular market. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Confirmation, Clearing and Settlement\n",
    "- This happens at the end of a executing a trading order. \n",
    "- Clearance is the recording and comparision of trade records \n",
    "- Settlement involves the actual delivery of the security and its payment\n",
